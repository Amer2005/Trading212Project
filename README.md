# Crypto Trading

## Overview

This project is a **web application** that simulates a cryptocurrency trading platform. It allows users to:

- View **real-time prices** of the top 20 cryptocurrencies using the **Kraken WebSocket API**
- Perform **virtual buy/sell** operations using a simulated account balance
- Track a complete **transaction history** including profit/loss details
- **Reset** their account to the initial state ($10,000 balance)

This is a simulated environment — no real transactions occur.
